# Online Python Tutor for the IPython Notebook

This JS plugin enables Philip Guo's excellent [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) to work within the IPython Notebook. This is very experimental and will likely evolve quite a bit before things settle down.

# Installation

To install this plugin:

1. Move the `pytutor` directory into the `static/jsplugins` directory of one of your IPython profiles.
2. Move the `.py` files in the `python` directory somewhere on your `PYTHONPATH`. One possible location is `~.ipython/extensions`.

# Usage

Have a look in the `notebooks` subdirectory to see examples of how this can be used.
